				<p>We have a dedicated customer service team that looks after your entire Food Delivery experience from the moment you place an order on our website through to it arriving at your doorstep. However, we do understand that sometimes things might go wrong. In the rare case that this happens, you can always contact us at mail@demolink.org or on +1 800 123 4567 and we will look into this for you.</p>

				<p>Our managers and couriers are always hopping along as quickly as they can, but sometimes things outside of our control can cause a delay. Where we can, we will always try and proactively call you if we feel that your order might not arrive within the estimated time of delivery, and our team will be working to get your order to you as quickly as possible.</p>

				<p>Yes, you can! After placing your order you will receive an order confirmation via email. Each order starts production 15 minutes hours after your order is placed. Within a few hours of you placing your order, you will receive an expected delivery time. When the order will be ready for delivery, you will receive another email with the tracking number and a link to trace the order online with the courier.</p>

				<p>
				  There are a few factors that we have to consider before we can issue a refund. Did your food not arrive or were you not able to receive your order and our courier left? If a refund is granted, just know that it will take about 5-7 business days, depending on your bank, before any money is back in your account.
